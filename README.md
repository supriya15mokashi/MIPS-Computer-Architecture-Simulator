# MIPS-Computer-Architecture-Simulator
• Developed a MIPS processor simulator that implements pipelined configuration for execution. • Realized a system that outputs the clock cycle time that each instruction completes each stage it passes through. • Designed a simulator to report the structural, data hazards and resulting pipeline stalls in the assembly code.
